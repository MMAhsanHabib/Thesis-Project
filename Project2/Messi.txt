Football is one such game where individuals are recognized despite there being evidence that a team cannot thrive on just individuals. Thus it presents a problem when people follow one team and opinions about individual awards are loosely based on a team’s trophy count.

Cristiano Ronaldo has won the biggest individual awards this season that football had to offer. Real Madrid reclaimed La Liga for the first time since 2012 and retained the UEFA Champions League by becoming the first team to win back-to-back titles since the Champions League began.

The hype around Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo often means that if one does well then the other recedes from memory. However one thing cannot be overlooked, that Messi still had a brilliant season and on Saturday he showed his mettle as Barcelona thrashed Real Madrid at the Bernabeu.

“There's little point in trying to deny what's as prominent as the nose on your face; Lionel Messi is the King of El Clasico,” Madrid based Marca wrote.

Indeed Messi has been decisive in many Clasico fixtures over the years and he seems to like taking Real Madrid apart at the Bernabeu. Last season the Argentine scored at the dying seconds to give Barcelona an incredible 2-3 win at the Bernabeu.
