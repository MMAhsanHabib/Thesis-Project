Cristiano Ronaldo scored a record-breaking goal and a stunning overhead bicycle kick to bury Juventus 3-0 on Tuesday in a rematch of last year's Champions League final. Ronaldo became the first player to score in 10 consecutive Champions League games as Real Madrid beat Juventus 3-0 in the first leg of the quarter-finals in Turin, but it was his second goal that everybody will remember.

The Portuguese superstar surpassed himself with a breathtaking overhead hit from inside the box to help put holders Real Madrid closer to the semi-finals.

"One of the most beautiful goals in the history of football," said Real Madrid coach Zinedine Zidane. It took him only two minutes and 47 seconds to open the scoring in Turin, flicking in Isco's cross.

But the jeers of the home fans turned to applause and earned him a standing ovation after 64 minutes when Dani Carvajal crossed back into the area where Ronaldo connected with an outrageous bicycle kick. Ronaldo responded by putting his hand to his heart and giving a slight bow of gratitude to the crowd. "The applause for Cristiano says it all," said Carvajal.

"Cristiano does things sometimes that only he can do," said Zidane.
